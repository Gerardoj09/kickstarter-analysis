## Overview of Project

#### More than four thousand crowdfunding campaings were studied to produce a dataset containing basic information to proceed with an analysis to find out correlations and tendencies.

### Purpose

#### The purpose of the project is to analyse the provided dataset to determine crucial factors for a crowdfunding campaing to be successful and help Louise, the up-and-coming playwright, to take data-driven desicions and have a reliable baseline to fund her play "Fever" by crowdfunding.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

#### This analysis has shown a moyority successful outcomes based on launch date reviewing the overall results; with this analysis is possible to know the outcomes filtered by parent category and by year, displaying the outcomes in everymonth. This way is easy to find out possible to detect a tendency of outcomes regarding category over time, or consult meticulously if an specific event like a pandemy affected the this industry.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

#### Analysing the outcomes based on goals, separating them by ranges of five thousanths, help us to review the quantity of campaigns within every goal range, according to their respective currencies. In this analysis is not feasible to have a reliable reference of what campaings are the one that have greater goals due to the data contains different types of currencies.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

#### Some possible difficulties may have been to work with blanks as this are quantitative and qualitative data; another possible difficulty may be work with the "name" or "blurb" content due to the special characters or symbols that are difficult to process. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

## Specifically talking about the outcomes based on launch date filtered only by years and parent category, is useful to identify the industry's behaviour and tendencies across historical data. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

## According to the outcomes based on goals, overall, there were more successful campaigns under $20k taking into account their respectives currencies before plummering; the cancelled campaigns were low all along the different ranges; and by last, the percentage of failed campaing began low, subtly increased until reached the higher value over the other campaings outcomes. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

## Some limitations regarding the data are that you cannot easily find or refer to a specific "name" due to a lack of serial structure, for example, an alphabetical one. Another limitations is the currency type, it must be standarized to achieve a fair comparisson; just a conversion would create more limitations.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

## Other possible useful information can be visualized in a table showing the successful outcomes filtering by subcategory and location in order to localize tendencies and to stablish baseline parameters in percentage. Additionally, the table analysing the outcomes based on launch date would show more useful data if instead of months, it would show years, with this modification it would show if there was a tendency of outcomes across the years.
